			<title><![CDATA[#02 - Paul Itoi: Stakwork, Sphinx Chat, and the Bitcoin Lightning Economy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Itoi is the founder and CEO of Stakwork, and has been a tech entrepreneur since the mid nineties.</p>
<p>In his 'spare' time, Paul is also one of the driving forces behind the open-source, bitcoin lightning-powered chat-app, called Sphinx.</p>
<p>As Paul puts it, Stakwork pays the bills, but Sphinx just needed to exist, so they built it.</p>
<p>Unlike most people, Paul's entry into bitcoin was not out of an interest in the investment case, or really anything to do with the 'base layer'. Instead, Paul was drawn in by his interest in the Lightning Network, a layer 2 solution devised to enhance bitcoin's scalability.</p>
<p>As you'll hear in this discussion, the Lightning Network greatly expands the utility of bitcoin, and in Paul's view, will be the impetus for an explosion of innovation, that will lead to bitcoin's adoption by billions of people.</p>
<p>One such innovation is the so-called 'podcasting 2.0' model, where you can stream sats to the content creators you are listening to. You determine how much you stream, and you only pay for as long as you listen. It's known as the 'value 4 value' model, and it is one method currently being explored to develop a more direct relationship between creator and consumer, mitigating the influence of platform censorship, and hopefully diminishing the reliance on the strictly ad-based models that dominate today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you'd like to give it a try, and stream sats to Paul and I while listening to this episode, you can do so using the Sphinx Chat app, available for download on the App Store and on Desktop. Another great option for doing so is Breeze Wallet, which can be found in the App Store and on Google Play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a full list of other apps to explore, visit newpodcastapps.com.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the support, and enjoy the show!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[#01 - Gigi: Introduction to Closing the Loop]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the inaugural episode of Closing the Loop, it is a genuine honor to introduce you to a highly respected bitcoiner and dear friend of mine, who goes by the name of Gigi.</p>
<p>Gigi is a father, educator, meme artist, author, philosopher, and someone who is fully committed to serving the bitcoin project and seeing it succeed.</p>
<p>He curates the website <a href="https://bitcoin-resources.com/" target="_blank">bitcoin-resources.com</a>, where much of the top bitcoin content can be found for anyone seeking to get up to speed.</p>
<p>His first book, <a href="https://21lessons.com/" target="_blank">21 Lessons</a>, is a fascinating and rich exploration of the many things he has learned from falling down the proverbial 'bitcoin rabbit hole.'</p>
<p>His forthcoming book, <a href="http://21waysbook.com/" target="_blank">21 Ways</a>, is a highly anticipated work from someone who has come to be considered amongst the most appreciated thinkers in the bitcoin space for the incredible depth of his understanding of the subject and his ability to articulate it in such a digestible yet profound way.</p>
<p>Gigi has committed his mind, body, and soul to bitcoin. As one of my closest friends, I couldn't be happier for the success his dedication and passion have manifested, culminating most recently in his position as lead developer at Seetee.</p>
<p>In this conversation, we discuss what makes Bitcoin so special and some of the motivations behind and plans for this podcast series.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
