			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to another episode of Closing the Loop.</p>
<p>Today's guest is Preston Pysh, Co-Creator of The Investors Podcast network, one of top global podcast brands for financial education.</p>
<p>While his podcast network covers the goings on in finance, investing, and economics broadly, Preston has more recently focused exclusively on bitcoin, hosting a weekly discussion with the top entrepreneurs, authors, and investors in this rapidly growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Preston is highly respected amongst his peers for his thoughtful, articulate, and insightful takes on the complex dynamics of the global economy and investing landscape, and the impact that the emergence of bitcoin is having on them.</p>
<p>Preston and I have spoken on a number of occasions, and it's always a pleasure to catch up with him, to hear how he is currently thinking about things, and what is currently captivating him most.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to another episode of Closing the Loop.</p>
<p>Today's guest is Dhruv Bansal, Co-founder and CSO at Unchained Capital.</p>
<p>Unchained, as it is known, is a bitcoin-native financial services company, which builds products to help individuals, and organizations, better custody and hodl their bitcoin.</p>
<p>Crucial to this is their focus on collaborative custody using multisig, which allows them to offer robust key management solutions, transparent bitcoin collateralized loans, retirement and inheritance planning, and likely much more in the future.</p>
<p>They've also built a great open source tool called Caravan, which not only supports their product offering, but makes valuable new ways of managing and using bitcoin available to everyone.</p>
<p>Dhruv is also a highly-regarded author in the bitcoin space, having written an extremely fascinating 3-part series called 'Bitcoin Astronomy', which I couldn't resist spending some time on in this conversation.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to another episode of Closing the Loop.</p>
<p>Today's guest is Whit Gibbs, co-founder and CEO of Compass Mining.</p>
<p>According to their website:</p>
<p>'Compass is a Bitcoin-first company, on a mission to support the decentralized growth of hashrate and strengthen network security, by helping more people learn, explore and mine Bitcoin.'</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, interest in bitcoin mining has seemingly exploded, as the industry has developed, and as more and more people begin to understand just how diverse its impact will be, and the opportunity that it therefore represents.</p>
<p>Additionally, many individuals are beginning to get involved, not just because of the financial incentives, but also because of a desire to contribute to the further decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Whit and his team have obviously struck a nerve with the market, and you really get the sense that they are developing a platform which will create many more opportunities, in the not so distant future.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[#05 - Roy Sheinfeld: The Interface of the Peer to Peer Lightning Economy w/ Breez]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's guest on Closing the Loop is Roy Sheinfeld.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy is the CEO and Co-Founder of Breez, a mobile app which aspires to be 'The interface of the peer to peer lightning economy'.</p>
<p>Roy and his team have taken a nascent, though still largely intimidating technology, and abstracted away much of the complexity, so that the average user can begin to interact with it, and leverage the tremendous value which the lightning network increasingly represents.</p>
<p>Podcasting 2.0, and the value for value model, are important focuses for us here at Closing the Loop, and Breez has been instrumental at making it easy for users to engage this emerging method of content consumption, and for that we're very grateful.</p>
<p>For full disclosure, Seetee has been so impressed by what Roy and his team are doing, that we've recently made an investment in Breez, to facilitate the continuation of their amazing work.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[#04 - Daniel Buchner: Decentralized Identity on Bitcoin w/ Microsoft's ION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's guest on Closing the Loop is Daniel Buchner.</p>
<p>Daniel is the Senior Product Manager for Decentralized Identity at Microsoft, which in March of 2021 culminated in the launch of ION.</p>
<p>ION is an open, public, permissionless Layer 2 Decentralized Identifier network, that runs atop the Bitcoin timechain.</p>
<p>As life becomes increasingly digital, and concerns around privacy and control of personal data become increasingly important, we thought it would be interesting to speak with Daniel, to see how he and the team at ION are leveraging bitcoin's unique attributes, to build solutions that put control of data back where it belongs - in the hands of each individual.</p>
<p>If you're listening to this show on a podcasting 2.0 app, thank you for supporting the emerging value 4 value publishing model (and if not, find an app here: https://podcastindex.org/apps).&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using one of these apps, you'll be 'donating' to the Human Rights Foundation, as Daniel has graciously directed his streaming sats to that organization :)</p>
<p>If you have any feedback on the show, or have any suggestions for future guests, please feel free to reach out and let me know.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[#03 - Harry Sudock: Bitcoin Mining at GRIID, the Evolution of Energy Production, and Human Flourishing]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to another episode of Closing the Loop.</p>
<p>Today's guest is Harry Sudock, VP of Strategy at GRIID, a company which procures<strong>&nbsp;low-cost, renewable energy,&nbsp;</strong>to build, manage, and operate a&nbsp;growing portfolio of&nbsp;<strong>vertically-integrated bitcoin mining facilities</strong>.</p>
<p>Harry is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the bitcoin mining industry, and extremely dedicated to the cause of Bitcoin generally.</p>
<p>I invited him on the show to discuss the mining ecosystem, the impact he believes it will have on energy companies and markets, and what the implications may be for humanity more broadly.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to invite you to listen to this episode on one of the many podcasting 2.0 apps that are currently available. Closing the Loop is dedicated to advancing technologies that promote individual sovereignty, and building means of censorship-resistant communications and publishing is a critical component of that. By using a podcasting 2.0 app like Breez Wallet or Sphinx Chat, you stream sats directly to the contributors of this show, in amounts YOU determine, with no middle man. For this show, Harry has chosen to opt for a kind of 'reverse sponsorship', by directing his stream of sats to the Human Rights Foundation. As a result, by listening to this podcast in a podcasting 2.0 app, you'll not only be learning about the transformational potential of bitcoin mining, but you'll also be supporting an organization who engages in the tireless work, of championing the cause of freedom around the world.</p>
<p>Pretty cool right?</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks in advance for the support, and enjoy the show!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[#02 - Paul Itoi: Stakwork, Sphinx Chat, and the Bitcoin Lightning Economy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Itoi is the founder and CEO of Stakwork, and has been a tech entrepreneur since the mid nineties.</p>
<p>In his 'spare' time, Paul is also one of the driving forces behind the open-source, bitcoin lightning-powered chat-app, called Sphinx.</p>
<p>As Paul puts it, Stakwork pays the bills, but Sphinx just needed to exist, so they built it.</p>
<p>Unlike most people, Paul's entry into bitcoin was not out of an interest in the investment case, or really anything to do with the 'base layer'. Instead, Paul was drawn in by his interest in the Lightning Network, a layer 2 solution devised to enhance bitcoin's scalability.</p>
<p>As you'll hear in this discussion, the Lightning Network greatly expands the utility of bitcoin, and in Paul's view, will be the impetus for an explosion of innovation, that will lead to bitcoin's adoption by billions of people.</p>
<p>One such innovation is the so-called 'podcasting 2.0' model, where you can stream sats to the content creators you are listening to. You determine how much you stream, and you only pay for as long as you listen. It's known as the 'value 4 value' model, and it is one method currently being explored to develop a more direct relationship between creator and consumer, mitigating the influence of platform censorship, and hopefully diminishing the reliance on the strictly ad-based models that dominate today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you'd like to give it a try, and stream sats to Paul and I while listening to this episode, you can do so using the Sphinx Chat app, available for download on the App Store and on Desktop. Another great option for doing so is Breeze Wallet, which can be found in the App Store and on Google Play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the support, and enjoy the show!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[#01 - Gigi: Introduction to Closing the Loop]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the inaugural episode of Closing the Loop, it is a genuine honor to introduce you to a highly respected bitcoiner and dear friend of mine, who goes by the name of Gigi.</p>
<p>Gigi is a father, educator, meme artist, author, philosopher, and someone who is fully committed to serving the bitcoin project and seeing it succeed.</p>
<p>He curates the website <a href="https://bitcoin-resources.com/" target="_blank">bitcoin-resources.com</a>, where much of the top bitcoin content can be found for anyone seeking to get up to speed.</p>
<p>His first book, <a href="https://21lessons.com/" target="_blank">21 Lessons</a>, is a fascinating and rich exploration of the many things he has learned from falling down the proverbial 'bitcoin rabbit hole.'</p>
<p>His forthcoming book, <a href="http://21waysbook.com/" target="_blank">21 Ways</a>, is a highly anticipated work from someone who has come to be considered amongst the most appreciated thinkers in the bitcoin space for the incredible depth of his understanding of the subject and his ability to articulate it in such a digestible yet profound way.</p>
<p>Gigi has committed his mind, body, and soul to bitcoin. As one of my closest friends, I couldn't be happier for the success his dedication and passion have manifested, culminating most recently in his position as lead developer at Seetee.</p>
<p>In this conversation, we discuss what makes Bitcoin so special and some of the motivations behind and plans for this podcast series.</p>
